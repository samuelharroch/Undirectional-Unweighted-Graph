This project is about a data structure calling Graph and specifically an undirectional unweighted graph.

The project contains 3 classes :
1. NodeData which implements the node_data interface
2. Graph_DS which implements the graph interface
3. Graph_Algo which implements the graph_algorithms interface

## The Classes

### NodeData
This class contains basic parameters and method on a node.
Each node as a unique key , a meta data ,tag and a collection of his neighbors- using HashMap
The methods are classic as update a node about new neighbor, asking a node if another node is connected to him ect..

### Graph_DS
The class use a hashMap to keep his nodes. The methods are classic and appropriate to
an undirectional unweighted graph.

### Graph_Algo
 This class implements  the "regular" Graph Theory algorithms including the short path between 2 nodes,
 the distance between them and if the graph is connected. These three methods use the BFS algorithms.
